For this project, we have taken the code from the repo at <https://github.com/hzxie/Pix2Vox> as our starting point. We modified the config and the decoder, disabled the merger and refiner, turning it into a general 3D reconstruction network before we tested our new loss functions on it. We also modified the utilities to suit our 2D projection losses.
